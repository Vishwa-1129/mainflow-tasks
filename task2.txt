Description: SQL aggregate functions perform a calculation on a set of values and return single value. They are often used with the GROUP BY clause to group rows that share a property, allowing for more complex data analysis. Common SQL aggregate functions include:
SUM(): Adds up all the values in a specified column.
AVG(): Calculates the average of the values in a specified column.
COUNT(): Counts the number of rows that match a specified condition.
MAX(): Finds the maximum value in a specified column.
MIN(): Finds the minimum value in a specified column.
